PCBOps is an  Open Source project dedicated to creating open source tools, templates, and best practices for automating the Design, Release, and Production of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assemblies (PCBA)  and other Hardware and Electrical Design Projects.

## Mission

The Mission of this project is to create complete end-to-end release automation, review, and monitoring ecosystem for Hardware Manufacturing Projects.

## Roadmap 

Initially the project will be to bring automation and integration of build outputs to existing open source EDA tools, namely KiCad and Related Mechanical Packages like FreeCAD.

Afterwards the project scope will expand rapidly to develop functionality on the Manfuacturing, Quality, and Operations side. Integration with manufacturing equipment, Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and Design Validation for Manufacturability, Component and Bill of Materials tracking for purchasing and planning, automation of auxiliary production operations including firmware programing, bring-up, test and burn-in


## Contributing

Anyone can contribute in whatever form and capacity they have. This project is new and formal channels of communication are being established. Please visit the github group https://github.com/pcbops and start an issue on any project or email the initial author akshmakov (at) gmail (dot) com
